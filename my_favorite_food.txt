Nigerian Jollof Rice is a flavorful and popular West African dish. Here's a traditional recipe to make it:

### Ingredients

#### For the rice:
- 2 cups long-grain parboiled rice
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1 large red bell pepper, diced
- 2 medium tomatoes, chopped
- 2-3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1-2 Scotch bonnet peppers (adjust to taste), finely chopped
- 3 cups chicken broth or water
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, minced
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)
- Salt and black pepper to taste

#### For the blended sauce:
- 4 medium tomatoes
- 1 large red bell pepper
- 1 large onion
- 1-2 Scotch bonnet peppers (adjust to taste)
- 2-3 cloves garlic
- 1-inch piece of ginger

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the blended sauce**:
   - Blend the tomatoes, red bell pepper, onion, Scotch bonnet peppers, garlic, and ginger until smooth. Set aside.

2. **Parboil the rice**:
   - Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Place the rice in a pot, add enough water to cover it, and parboil for about 5 minutes. The rice should still be firm (al dente). Drain and set aside.

3. **Cook the base**:
   - Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until soft and translucent.
   - Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for another 2 minutes.
   - Stir in the tomato paste and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the paste is well incorporated and starts to darken.

4. **Add the blended sauce**:
   - Pour the blended sauce into the pot and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce reduces and thickens. The oil will start to separate from the tomato mixture.

5. **Season and add vegetables**:
   - Add the diced red bell pepper, bay leaves, thyme, curry powder, smoked paprika (if using), salt, and black pepper. Stir well to combine.

6. **Cook the rice**:
   - Add the parboiled rice to the pot and stir to coat the rice with the sauce. Pour in the chicken broth or water, ensuring the liquid covers the rice by about an inch.
   - Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. Avoid stirring the rice while it cooks to prevent it from becoming mushy.

7. **Fluff and serve**:
   - Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat. Let it sit, covered, for about 5 minutes.
   - Fluff the rice with a fork, removing the bay leaves, and serve.

### Tips

- **Protein options**: Jollof rice is often served with fried plantains, grilled chicken, beef, or fish.
- **Vegetarian option**: You can make it vegetarian by using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.
- **Adjust heat**: The Scotch bonnet peppers add significant heat. Adjust the quantity based on your spice preference.
