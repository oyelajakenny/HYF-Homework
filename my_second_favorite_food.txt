Beans and plantain is a popular Nigerian dish that combines the hearty flavor of beans with the sweetness of ripe plantains. Here’s a simple recipe to make this delicious meal:

### Ingredients

#### For the beans:
- 2 cups black-eyed peas or Nigerian brown beans
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-2 Scotch bonnet peppers (adjust to taste), chopped
- 1/4 cup palm oil or vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon ground crayfish (optional)
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon paprika or ground red pepper
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Water for cooking

#### For the plantain:
- 2-3 ripe plantains
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Salt to taste

### Instructions

#### For the beans:

1. **Prepare the beans**:
   - Sort and rinse the beans thoroughly. Soak them in water for a few hours or overnight to reduce cooking time and improve digestibility.

2. **Cook the beans**:
   - Drain the soaked beans and place them in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the beans by about 2 inches.
   - Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the beans are tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Check occasionally and add more water if needed.

3. **Prepare the sauce**:
   - In a separate pan, heat the palm oil or vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until they are soft and translucent.
   - Add the minced garlic and chopped Scotch bonnet peppers. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.

4. **Combine and season**:
   - Once the beans are tender, drain any excess water. Add the cooked onion mixture to the beans and stir well.
   - Add ground crayfish (if using), dried thyme, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Stir to combine and let it simmer for an additional 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.

#### For the plantain:

1. **Prepare the plantains**:
   - Peel the plantains by cutting off the ends, making a shallow cut along the length of the plantain, and then peeling off the skin. Slice the plantains into desired shapes, either rounds or diagonal slices.

2. **Fry the plantains**:
   - Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the plantain slices in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.
   - Fry until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes on each side. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with a little salt to taste.

3. **Serve**:
   - Serve the cooked beans alongside the fried plantains. Enjoy your delicious beans and plantain meal!

### Tips

- **Soaking the beans**: Soaking the beans overnight helps reduce cooking time and improves their texture.
- **Spice level**: Adjust the amount of Scotch bonnet peppers according to your heat preference.
- **Healthier option**: For a healthier version, you can bake the plantains instead of frying them. Toss the plantain slices in a little oil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 20 minutes, turning halfway through until golden brown.
